# Profile
profile: |
  I'm a writer and first-wave Web hacker who has kept current with the modern web stack, developed an interest in ML-driven web apps, and found in Developer Advocacy a priceless opportunity to turn personal obsessions into teachable code. I'm open to freelance assignments, contracts, and full-time employment.

      AWS Lambdas: Easy, Easier, Easiest (Apr 2021)
    link: https://januff.github.io/easy-easier-easiest-lambdas/
    details: |
      Quickstarts for AWS Lambda (“serverless”) functions in React, with and without AWS tooling. Functions connect to a serverless Apache Cassandra database.

  - title: textify-typeset-translation (Jul 2021)
    link: https://github.com/januff/textify-typeset-translation
    details: |
      Textify is a simple scanlation editor–a CRUD with cloud ML hooks–inspired by my fascination with international comics corpora, particularly Indonesia's unofficial (and still largely uncharted) branching of the Marvel and DC Universes in the late 1960s and '70s.
