# Profile
profile: |
  I'm a first-wave Web hacker who's kept current with the modern web stack, and who's keeping up (mostly) with the emerging ML stack. As a freelance Developer Advocate, I've enjoyed opportunities to turn cloud ML experiments into teachable code but I'm eager to make the ML developer experience my full-time focus.

# Experience
experience:
  - role: Developer Advocate (Freelance)
    time: 2021-2022
    company: StepZen
    details: |
      StepZen is a provider of ‘GraphQL-as-a-service’, helping developers  consolidate multiple backends into a single GraphQL endpoint. In 2021 and 2022, I blogged about a series of StepZen-orchestrated interactions with the Spotify and YouTube APIs, including bundling biography from Google's Knowledge Graph API and exporting playlists across services.
    # technologies_used: | 
    #   GraphQL, Remix, YouTube API, Spotify API
  
  - role: Developer Advocate (Contract)
    time: 2020-2021
    company: DataStax
    details: |
      DataStax offers a real-time cloud DB built on Apache Cassandra. In support of DataStax's serverless Stargate API debut of late 2020, I blogged my demo of an international comics translation editor using AWS's Predictions API and DataStax's cloud Cassandra DB.

  - title: textify-typeset-translation (Jul 2021)
    link: https://github.com/januff/textify-typeset-translation
    details: |
      Textify is a simple scanlation editor–a CRUD with cloud ML hooks–inspired by my fascination with international comics corpora, particularly Indonesia's unofficial (and still largely uncharted) branching of the Marvel and DC Universes in the late 1960s and '70s.
