# Profile
profile: |
  I'm a writer and first-wave Web hacker who has kept current with the modern web stack, sustained an interest in ML-driven web apps, and found in Developer Advocacy the opportunity to turn personal fascinations into teachable code.

    link: https://github.com/januff/textify-typeset-translation
    details: |
      Textify is a simple scanlation editor–a CRUD with cloud ML hooks–inspired by my fascination with international comics corpora, particularly Indonesia's unofficial (and still largely uncharted) branching of the Marvel and DC Universes in the late 1960s and '70s.
